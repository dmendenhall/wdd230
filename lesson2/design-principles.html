                        <p>There is a lot of content on this site and so it can be very easy to get lost or 
                            to be able to distinguish one section from another; but they have done a good job 
                            of allowing plenty of white space to allow the visitor to focus on each section. 
                            They've added additional white space between sections to make it easier to 
                            differentiate one from the other and I believe their choice to leave most of the 
                            background white, especially behind the text, makes it appear cleaner and lends 
                            to an improved comprehension for the site visitor.</p>

                    <h1>Repetition</h1>
                    <h2>Desert Star</h2>
                    <a href="https://desertstar.biz/" target="_blank">desertstar.biz</a>
                    <p> The site is busy and has a lot of colors on it for each specific show, but they have 
                        done an excellent job in using and repeating the same pattern for each of their graphics. 
                        There is white space between sections to allow for an easy distinction and then each 
                        graphic has the name of the show in a large fun font with a smaller font below that 
                        provides additional context. They've also repeated the red banner at the bottom of the
                        graphic with the dates of the show. Overall, the visitor to their site can establish 
                        a reasonable expectation as to what will be next because of the repetition within their 
                        site.</p>

                        <p>This site has a significant amount of graphics and is broken down into different 
                            sections to convey to the visitor what to expect. The way the site is laid out by 
                            grouping certain shows together and under a heading allows us to more easily make 
                            sense of the information and what to expect. It is the proximity of each graphic 
                            to the next that alerts us to the idea that they belong within the same group and 
                            by looking at the section title, I am able to determine what that is.</p>
